## What is GPIO?

General-Purpose Input/Output, or GPIO, is an essential part of embedded systems that serves as a vital conduit between microcontrollers and microprocessors and the outside world. A microcontroller or microprocessor's group of pins that can each be set to operate as an input or an output is referred to as GPIO. The purpose of these pins is to interface external components, including actuators, displays, sensors, and other devices, so that the embedded system may communicate with its surroundings. Standardised communication protocols like SPI, I2C, PCM, PWM, and serial communication may be directly supported by some GPIO pins. There are two varieties of GPIO pins: digital and analog.

## Configuring GPIO Pins

GPIO pins can be used as outputs (LEDs, motors, buzzers) or as inputs (buttons, sensors).

The RP2040 and RP2350 have three peripherals that control the GPIO pins:
 1. *Pads* - control the actual physical pin or pad that the processor has outside. They control the electrical parameters, like maximum current or pull up and pull down resistors
 2. *IO Bank0* - connects and multiplexes the peripheral's pins to the output pads. Several peripherals use the same output pad to communicate with the exterior. For example, in the image below, `GPIO0` can be used either for:
    * `SIO` - the `GPIO` function
    * `SPI_RX` - the receive pin for the `SPI` peripheral
    * `I2C0_SDA` - the data pin for the `I2C0` peripheral
    * `UART0_TX` - the transmit pin for the `UART0` (serial port 0) peripheral
 3. *SIO* - that controls the interior MCU's pins. This is the peripheral that developers use to read and write the value of the pins.

![Pico2W Pinout](images/pico2w-pinout.svg)

Every pin of the MCU can perform multiple functions. Several peripherals need to use input and output pins.
It is the role of the *IO Bank0* to multiplex and connect the peripherals to the pins.

## Hardware access

There are 3 different ways in which the hardware the Raspberry Pi Pico can be used:

1. Embassy framework, with the Embedded HAL implementation
2. Platform Access Crate (PAC)
3. Bare metal

## Embassy Framework

Developing bare metal firmware requires a lot of time. 

In trying to standardize firmware development, The Rust [Embedded devices Working Group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/wgs/embedded) has designed 
a set of standard traits (interfaces) for interacting with an MCU. This is called the **Embedded Hardware Abstraction Layer**, or shortly Embedded HAL. The main purpose is to define a common hardware interface that
frameworks, libraries and operating systems can build upon. Regardless of what MCUs the device is using, the upper level software should be as portable as possible.

There are several crates that implement the Embedded HAL traits for the RP2040 and RP2350 MCUs. These
crates are called *HAL Implementations*.
- [rp2350_hal](https://docs.rs/rp235x-hal/latest/rp235x_hal/) crate, implements just the embedded HAL traits, it is *the bare minimum* for developing RP2350 applications
- [rp2040_hal](https://docs.rs/rp2040-hal/latest/rp2040_hal/) crate, implements just the embedded HAL traits, it is *the bare minimum* for developing RP2040 applications
- [embassy-rp](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/git/rp2040/index.html) crate implements the Embedded HAL for RP2040 and RP2350 that is used with the [embassy-rs](https://embassy.dev/) framework

Several frameworks are available on top of the *HAL Implementations* to speed things up. The most common used ones are:
- [RTIC - The hardware accelerated Rust RTOS](https://rtic.rs) - *A concurrency framework for building real-time systems*
- [Embassy](https://embassy.dev) - *The next-generation framework for embedded applications*

### The Software Stack

[Embassy](https://embassy.dev/) is a full fledged embedded framework for Rust embedded development.
Besides the implementation of the embedded HAL for different MCUs (RP2040 and RP2350 included), Embassy provides
several functions like timers, BLE and network communication.

### *Empty* Embassy Firmware

The Embassy Framework is a collection of crates. Building an *empty* firmware that uses
embassy requires:
- adding the Embassy HAL Implementation for a specific board, in this case RP2350;
- adding the core Embassy crates, that provide the executor, timers and futures;
- adding the `cortex-m-rt` and `defmt` crates that Embassy requires.

```

The `embassy-rp` crate provides support for the Raspberry Pi RP2350 
microcontroller within the Embassy framework. It includes features such 
as `defmt` for efficient debugging, `unstable-pac` for accessing low-level 
peripherals, and `time-driver` for handling time-related operations. 
The crate also implements `critical-section` for safe concurrency and 
supports `rp235xa` and `binary-info` for additional RP2350-specific 
functionality.  

The `embassy-embedded-hal` crate provides embedded-hal-compatible utilities 
for asynchronous embedded development. It enables easy interaction with 
hardware peripherals, such as GPIO, SPI, and I2C, while integrating with 
the Embassy async runtime. It includes `defmt` for lightweight debugging.  

The `embassy-sync` crate offers synchronization primitives and data 
structures designed for async environments. It includes mutexes, signal 
primitives, and channel-based communication for safe, cooperative 
multitasking. The crate is optimized for `no_std` systems and supports 
`defmt` for debugging.  

The `embassy-executor` crate provides an async/await executor tailored for 
embedded systems. It supports multitasking via interrupt-based and 
thread-based execution models, with optimizations for Cortex-M 
microcontrollers. Features include configurable task arena sizes and 
`defmt` for debugging.  

The `embassy-futures` crate supplies utilities for working with Rust futures 
in embedded environments. It is designed to be compatible with `no_std` 
and avoids dynamic memory allocation, making it lightweight and efficient 
for constrained devices.  

The `embassy-time` crate handles timekeeping, delays, and timeouts in async 
applications. It provides a high-precision time driver and supports uptime-based 
timestamps for logging. The crate is optimized for `no_std` 
environments and integrates with `defmt`.  

The `embassy-usb` crate provides a USB device stack for embedded systems. It 
supports USB control, bulk, and interrupt transfers, making it useful for 
implementing HID, CDC, and other USB classes. It integrates with `defmt` 
for debugging and logging.  

The `embassy-net` crate implements a network stack with support for TCP, 
UDP, and raw Ethernet frames. It includes DHCPv4 for automatic IP 
configuration and DNS resolution. The crate is designed for embedded 
networking and integrates with `defmt` for efficient debugging.  

The `embassy-net-wiznet` crate adds support for WIZnet Ethernet modules to 
the Embassy networking stack. It provides an async interface for handling 
network communication over SPI-connected WIZnet chips, with `defmt` 
integration for logging.  

The `embassy-usb-logger` crate enables USB-based logging for embedded 
applications. It provides a mechanism for transmitting log messages over 
USB, allowing for real-time debugging and monitoring of embedded systems.  

The `log` crate is a lightweight logging facade that allows messages to be 
recorded using different logging backends. It is widely used in Rust 
projects, including embedded systems, to enable flexible debugging and 
monitoring.  

The `cyw43` crate provides support for the CYW43 Wi-Fi chip, commonly found 
on Raspberry Pi Pico W. It includes firmware logging, `defmt` integration, 
and an async interface for managing Wi-Fi connections in embedded systems.  

The `cyw43-pio` crate offers PIO (Programmable I/O) support for the CYW43 
Wi-Fi chip, enabling efficient SPI communication between the microcontroller 
and the Wi-Fi module. It includes `defmt` logging for debugging low-level 
interactions.  

### Entry

Embassy is a framework built on top of `cortex-m-rt` and provides its own method of defining
the entrypoint and bootloader.

```rust
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

use embassy_executor::Spawner;

#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(_spawner: Spawner) {
    let peripherals = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());
}
```

The `embassy_rp::init` function takes care of the peripheral initialization so that developers can jump
right in and use them.

:::note

Embassy is designed to work in an asynchronous way and this is why the `main` function is defined as `async`. For the time being, just take it as a must and ignore it.

:::

### Configure GPIO Output

Embassy provides one single function that returns the GPIO `Output` pin and hides the configuration
details from developers.

The `pin` variable implements the embadded HAL [`OutputPin`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/digital/trait.OutputPin.html) trait.

```rust
use gpio::{Level, Output};

// initialize PIN_n (replace n with a number) and set its
// default value to LOW (0)
let mut pin = Output::new(peripherals.PIN_n, Level::Low);

// set the pin value to HIGH (1)
pin.set_high();

// set the pin value to LOW (0)
pin.set_low();
```

:::tip

While the device initialization is specific to every hardware device (the example uses the 
`embassy_rp` crate that is for RP2350 and RP2040), the pin initialization and usage is portable. It
uses the same code, regardless of the MCU used.

:::

### Configure GPIO Input

Using a pin as input is very similar to using it as output.

```rust
use gpio::{Input, Pull};

let pin = Input::new(peripherals.PIN_n, Pull::Up);

if pin.is_high() {
    // Do something if the pin value is HIGH (1)
} else {
    // Do something if the pin value if LOW (0)
}
```

:::warning 

For a correct use of the buttons, use pull-up, pull-down resistors depending on the mode of operation of the button. Check <ElectronicsTutorial title="Buttons" anchor="buttons"/> section from the <ElectronicsTutorial/>.

:::

### Waiting

Embassy provides support for suspending the execution of the software for an amount of time. It uses
the [`Timer`](https://docs.rs/embassy-time/0.3.0/embassy_time/struct.Timer.html) structure from the
[`embassy_time`](https://docs.rs/embassy-time/latest/embassy_time/) crate.

```rust
// suspend the execution for a period of time
use embassy_time::Timer;

Timer::after_secs(1).await;
```

:::tip

If the MCU provides timers, the Embassy framework will use them to suspend the software. This is very efficient.

## The lab board

This lab makes use of the hardware available on the lab board. The board provides:
- Raspberry Pi Pico/2 Slot
- RP2040 Debugger
- 4 buttons
- 5 LEDs
- potentiometer
- buzzer
- photoresistor
- I2C EEPROM
- BMP280 Pressure & Temp. sensor
- SPI LCD Display
- SD Card Reader
- USB-C connector
- servo connectors

![Lab Board](images/lab_board.png)

:::danger
Please make sure you use the **USB-C connector** to connect the board to the computer.
:::

### Wiring

All the electronic components, sensors and actuators, have the power pins hard wired
to the board. This means that all the components receive power from the board
and do not have to be powered separately.

The data pins of the components are not wired and have to be connected to the
Raspberry Pi Pico using [jumper wires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_wire).

### Raspberry Pi Pico Pins

Each pin on the Raspberry PI Pico 2 is connected to **two-hole connectors** positioned 
along the sides of the socket, marked with labels like **GP0, GP1, GP2**, etc. 
These holes provide an easy way to access the **GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) 
pins** of the Pico 2.

![Lab Board Connectors](./images/lab_board_gp.png)

You have to use jumper wires to interface with the Pico 2âs GPIO pins as follows:
1. Insert a **male jumper wire** into one of the pin holes corresponding to the desired GPIO pin.
2. Connect **the other end** of the jumper wire to an external circuit, such as a breadboard, 
    another microcontroller, or a peripheral device. In this case, it will be LEDs or Switches.
3. Use the **second hole** of the same pin as an additional connection point, 
    allowing multiple devices to share the same GPIO.

:::warning
Pins `GP0` and `GP1` should only be used for UART (Serial) communication
as they are connected to the lab board's debugger chip.
:::


### LEDs and Switches

The board provides four single colored LEDs, red, green, blue and yellow. Each one of them
uses one pin for control. Each LED connector has one single hole on the board,
marked with `RED`, `GREEN', `BLUE` and `YELLOW` respectively. These are located in the **Connectors**
section of the board.

The four switches that the lab board provides are signaled with labels
`SW4`, `SW5`, `SW6` and `SW7` in the connectors section.


![Lab Board Connectors](./images/lab_board_connectors.png)

:::warning
Switches on the lab board have a pull-up resistor. This means that:
1. The values it provides may be counter-intuitive:

| Position | Value |
|-|-|
| Pressed | `LOW` |
| Released | `HIGH` |

2. Pins that connect to switches have to be set up as `Pull::None` to disable the Raspberry Pi 2 Pico's
    internal pull resistor.
:::

### Example

To wire the green LED to pin 0 of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2, a jumper cable is required
between holes `GREEN` and `GP7`.

## Exercises

1. Write an *empty* firmware that uses the Embassy Framework and `defmt`. (**1p**)
Make sure you follow these steps:
- create a new Rust project using `cargo init`;
- add the `.cargo/config.toml` file that instructs `cargo` to [cross-compile](./01#using-a-configuration-file) for the `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf`
  architecture, add `probe-rs run` as a [runner](./01#using-cargo-run) and set [`defmt` messages filtering](./01#filtering-messages) to `DEBUG`;
- add the [linker script](./01#linker-script) file called `memory.x`;
- add the [build script](./01#build-script) file called `build.rs`;
- add the required *Embassy* dependencies - take a look at [*Empty* Embassy Firmware](#empty-embassy-firmware) - take a look at [*Empty* Firmware](./01#empty-firmware);
- use `defmt_rtt` as a logger, make sure you import it even if you are not using it directly `use ... as _`;
- use `panic-probe` to provide a panic handler, make sure you import it even if you are not using it directly `use ... as _`;
- ask the Rust compiler not to depend on the standard library, 
    not to provide a main function and 
    add the *Embassy* [entry](#entry);
- write the code to print the `info!` message "Device started".

Please make sure you comment out (using `#` in from of the line) all the Embassy's crates 
that you do not plan to use.

:::info
For sure, you will  not use USB and WiFi. This is a trial
and error job, just comment out all the creates that you think you won't use and
add them back if the compiler asks for them.
:::

To prevent `rust-analyzer` from showing an error on the first line and to automatically
format your source when saving, create a `.vscode/settings.json` file with:

:::tip
```json
{
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.allTargets": false,
    "[rust]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "rust-lang.rust-analyzer",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.formatOnSaveMode": "file",
    },
}
```
:::

2. Write a program using Embassy that set on HIGH the LED connected to GPIO pin 2 (GP2). (**2p**)

:::danger 

Please make sure the lab professor verifies your circuit before it is powered up.

:::

3. Write a program using Embassy that blinks the LED connected to GPIO pin 2 (GP2) 
every 300ms. (**2p**)

:::note

For the purpose of this lab, please use `await` as is, think that for 
using the `Timer`, you have to add `.await` after the `after` function.

:::

4. Write a program using Embassy that will write the
message "The button was pressed" to the console every time button SW5 is pressed. 
Make sure you connect the switch SW5 to a Raspberry Pi Pico pin. (**2p**)

5. Write a Rust program using Embassy that toggles the LED every time button SW5 is pressed. (**1p**)

6. Instead of constantly sampling for the button value, use the [`wait_for_`](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/git/rp2040/gpio/struct.Input.html#method.wait_for_low) functions to 
wait for the value to change. (**2p**)

:::tip
Do not forget to write the `.await` keyword at the end of an `async` function call.
:::

## Platform Access Crate (PAC)

A mid level way of developing in Rust for MCUs are the *platform access crates* 
(PAC). These crates are automatically generated from the *System View Description* (SVD) files.

Using [rust2svd](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/latest/svd2rust/), developers can automatically generate
a crate that provides access functions to the MCUs registers. This provides a significant improvement,
as developers do not have to write manually the register addresses.

One of the PAC crates for the RP2040 MCU is [rp2040-pac](https://docs.rs/rp2040-pac/latest/rp2040_pac/).

:::note

The PAC crate does not provide any means of initializing the MCU, so the entry point is still
defined by the `cortex-m-rt` crate, just as it is for bare metal. Bare metal will be discussed later in the lab.

Similarly, the PAC crate does not provide any `sleep` function.

This section presents only the differences between bare metal and PAC. The PAC mode of writing 
embedded software is very similar to bare metal, just that register access is made easier.

:::

The RP2040 (ARM Cortex-M0+) MCU uses *Memory Mapped Input Output* (MMIO). This means that the peripheral's registers
are mapped into the address space (in normal words, in the memory). Reading and writing data from and to these registers
is done by memory reads and writes.

Blinking an LED in PAC or bare metal programming means following these steps:

 1. Ask the rust compiler not to use the `std` library, as it depends on the operating system
 2. Write a `main` function and instruct the MCU to call it at startup (reset)
 3. Configure the Single Cycle IO (SIO) peripheral to set a pin as output
 4. Enable the *IO Bank0* peripheral of the RP2040
 5. Configure the *IO Bank0* peripheral so that it sets a certain pin as output
 6. Toggle the pin's value through the *SIO*'s registers
 7. Wait for an amount of time
 8. Loop through steps 6 and 7

### Bootloader

The RP2040 has a piece of software written in an internal ROM memory that is loaded 
when the MCU boots. This looks at the first 256 bytes of the Flash memory
to understand how it needs to start the MCU.

:::tip

While the ROM bootloader is rather small, its functionality is very similar to the PC's BIOS
boot sequence.

:::

The RP2040's datasheet explains the boot process. This is not very straight forward, and writing this
information requires a digital signature. The `rp2040-boot` crate provides the bootloader information
for booting with the `cortex-m-rt` crate.

Adding the following code to the Rust includes the bootloader.

```rust
#[link_section = ".boot_loader"]
#[used]
pub static BOOT_LOADER: [u8; 256] = rp2040_boot2::BOOT_LOADER_W25Q080;
```

### Entry

For this lab, we will use the `cortex-m-rt` crate. As the starting code for an MCU is usually processor
and vendor dependent, this crate allows developers to get started a little faster. It implements the bare minimum
initialization code and provides a macro called `entry` that developers can use to select the startup (main)
function.

:::info

The `entry` macro is used by Embassy through the `embassy_executor::main` macro that sets the `main` function as the startup point and defines the correct bootloader.

:::

When an error occurs, Rust calls the `panic` function. When using the `std` library, the `panic` function is
already defined. It prints the error and usually unwinds the stack. When using `core`, it is the developer's
job to define a `panic` function. In the case of bare metal development, the simplest `panic` function is 
one that loops indefinitely, preventing the MCU form executing code.

```rust
use core::panic::PanicInfo;

use cortex_m_rt::entry;

// the `entry` macro sets up this function
// as the function that the MCU calls at
// startup
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    // the `main` function is not allows to return
    loop { }
}

// rust uses panics when an error occurs
// as this is bare metal, we have to define
// the panic function that rust calls
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    // if an error occurs, we simply loop around
    // to prevent the MCU from executing 
    // anything
    loop {}
}
```

:::warning

In PAC or bare metal mode, the MCU does not run any framework or operating system, it just runs the developers bare metal code. This is why `main` function is not allowed to return, it loops forever. There is no system to which the function
could return control.

:::

One of the first lines of the `main` function is getting a reference to all the
peripherals.

```rust
use rp2040_pac::Peripherals;

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    // get a reference to all the peripherals
    let peripherals = Peripherals::take().unwrap();

    loop { }
}
```

:::info

In Embassy, the `main` function does not have to loop indefinitely, it is allowed to return, as it runs within the embassy-rs framework.

### Configuring the SIO

In bare metal and PAC modes, developers have to manually initialize the *IO Bank0* and *SIO* peripherals.

The GPIO pins are configured using the MCU's SIO registers. Each pin is configured by setting or clearing the corresponding
bit of several registers. Below is a table with the memory addresses of the SIO registers. 

The PAC crate provides the `SIO` peripheral, which in turn provides a function for
each one of its registers. It fully hides the actual address of the registers.

<div align="center">
![SIO Registers](images/sio_registers.png)
</div>

```rust
let sio = peripherals.SIO;

// set the `pin` pin as output
sio.gpio_oe_set().write(|w| unsafe { w.bits(1 << pin) });

// set the `pin` to value `0`
sio.gpio_out_clr().write(|w| unsafe { w.bits(1 << pin) })

// set the `pin` to value `1`
sio.gpio_out_set().write(|w| unsafe { w.bits(1 << pin) })
```

### Configuring the IO Bank0

GPIO pins can be configured for several functionalities, they can be used as GPIO pins or can also be used by certain peripherals, usually those that implement communication protocols. The RP2040's *IO Bank0* peripherals performs this multiplexing.

The following table provides all the functions that each pin can have.

<div align="center">
![Pin Functions](images/pin_functions.png)
</div>

#### Enable the IO Bank0

When the RP2040 starts, the *IO Bank0* peripheral is disabled. To enable it, developers have to
use the *Reset*'s peripheral `RESET`  register.

<div align="center">
![Reset Registers](images/reset_registers.png)
</div>

The fields of the `RESET` register. To enable *IO Bank0*, developers have to write
a `0` in the `IO_BANK0` fields. By default, this field has the value `1`, which means that
`*IO Bank0* is disabled.

<div align="center">
![Reset Register](images/reset_reset.png)
</div>

To verify that the *IO Bank0* peripheral has been enabled, developers have to check the field
`IO_BANK0` of the `RESET_DONE` register shown in the table bellow.

<div align="center">
![Reset Done Register](images/reset_reset_done.png)
</div>

:::warning

Developers might choose not to wait until the peripheral is enabled, but any writes to the peripheral's
registers will most probably be ignored.

:::

```rust
let reset = peripherals.RESETS;

reset
    .reset()
    .modify(|r, w| unsafe { w.bits(r.bits() & !(1 << 5)) });
while reset.reset_done().read().bits() & (1 << 5) == 0 {}
```

#### Configure the GPIO

To connect the *SIO* peripheral to the output pins, developers have to modify the `GPIOx_CTRL` register.

The following table shows the fields of the `GPIOx_CTRL` register. The fields that is of interest is `FUNCSEL`.
Depending on the value written there, the *IO Bank0* will select a function or another. For this example,
we have to write value `5`.

<div align="center">
![MCU Pins](images/gpio_ctrl_register.png)
</div>

```rust
let io_bank0 = peripherals.IO_BANK0;

// write the value 5 to the FUNCSEL field
// Note: This actually writes the value 5 in FUNCSEL
//       and 0s in all the other field. While this
//       is fine for this example, usually a
//       read, modify, write sequence should be used
io_bank0
    .gpio(pin)
    .gpio_ctrl()
    .write(|w| unsafe { w.bits(5) });

// the correct way of doing this
io_bank0
    .gpio(pin)
    .gpio_ctrl()
    // the PAC crate provides fucntions for all the 
    // register's fields
    .modify(|_, w| unsafe { w.funcsel().bits(5) });
```

### Configuring the Pad

The Pad peripheral is responsible for the electrical setup of the pins. It can configure the
the maximum output current, input pull up or pull down resistor.

The following table shows the *Pads* peripheral registers. Each GPIO pin has a corresponding register.

<div align="center">
![Pad Registers](images/gpio_pad_registers.png)
</div>

The following tables describe the `GPIOx` register. This register allows the configuration of several
electrical parameters.

<div align="center">
![Pad Pad Control 2](images/gpio_pad_ctrl_2.png)
</div>

<div align="center">
![Pad Pad Control 1](images/gpio_pad_ctrl_1.png)
</div>

Looking at the default values, when the MCU starts, pins are configured:

| | |
|-|-|
| Output Enabled | Yes |
| Input Enabled | Yes |
| Maximum Output Current | 4mA |
| Pull Input Resistor | Pull Down |
| Schmidt Trigger | Yes |
| Slew Rate | Slow |

For this lab, the default values are fine, this peripheral can be considered as being properly setup.

### Wait for an amount of time

When using an operating system, developers usually have a function called `sleep` which asks the operating system
to suspend the process for a certain amount of time. In bare metal environment, with no framework or operating system,
this is not available. The MCU timers can be used for this, but the simplest (and most inefficient) of waiting is to
loop around while doing nothing. The Arm Cortex-M processors offer the `nop` instruction. This asks the processor
to do nothing.

```rust
// loops around 50000 times asking the processor
// to execute the `nop` instruction that does
// nothing
for _ in 0..50000 {
    // without this `asm` here, the compiler would optimize out the loop
    asm!("nop");
}
```

:::warning

The `asm("nop")` is necessary, as otherwise the compiler optimizes out the empty loop.

:::

The question is how fast does this execute. The RP2040 starts by default using an internal 12MHz clock.

$$
t_{nop} = \frac{1}{12.000.000}s = 0.83ns
$$

The `loop` itself and the range (`0..50000`) calculation take another 4 - 5 MCU cycles. The actual wait time
of the example is:

$$
t_{wait} = 5 * 50000 * \frac{1}{12.000.000}s = 20.83\mu s
$$

:::info

This approach is inefficient compared to the method used in Embassy.

:::

## Bare metal

When using bare metal, developers interact directly with the hardware devices. They are responsible for all the
drivers and other components that they want to use. Mostly, bare metal development means *reading* and *writing* data
from and to the MCUs and peripheral registers.

### Configuring the SIO

The *SIO* peripheral has a base address, the address where its registers are mapped in the address space.

Each register has an offset, that represents the registers position (offset) relative to the *SIO*'s base address. 

:::tip

Computing the actual address of a register means adding the base address of the peripheral with the register's offset.

e.g: `GPIO_OE`'s address is `0xd000_0000 + 0x020` => `0xd000_0020`

:::

<div align="center">
![SIO Registers](images/sio_registers.png)
</div>

```rust
use core::ptr::write_volatile;

const GPIO_OE_SET: *mut u32 = 0xd000_0024 as *mut u32;
const GPIO_OUT_SET: *mut u32 = 0xd000_0014 as *mut u32;
const GPIO_OUT_CLR: *mut u32 = 0xd000_0018 as *mut u32;

// set the `pin` pin as output
unsafe { write_volatile(GPIO_OE_SET, 1 << pin); }

// set the `pin` to value `0`
unsafe { write_volatile(GPIO_OUT_CLR, 1 << pin); }

// set the `pin` to value `1`
unsafe { write_volatile(GPIO_OUT_SET, 1 << pin); }
```

:::info 

For a better understanding, please read subchapters 2.3.1.2 and 2.3.1.7 of the [datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf).

:::

#### Enable the IO Bank

```rust
const RESET: u32 = 0x4000_c000;
const CLR: u32 = 0x3000;

const RESET_DONE: u32 = 0x4000_c008;

unsafe {
    // clear bit `5` of the `RESET` register by
    // writing `1` on  bit `5` at address
    // `RESET` + 0x3000
    write_volatile((RESET + CLR) as *mut u32, 1 << 5);

    // wait for the IO Bank0 to enable
    while read_volatile(RESET_DONE as *const u32) & (1 << 5) == 0 {}
}
```

:::tip

There is an interesting trick that the code above is using. Normally, the code modifies only the
bit 5 of the `RESET` register. To perform that, it should:
1. read the register
2. modify the value read
3. write back the modified value

The RP2040 MCU provides a trick that allows the instant modification. For each peripheral mapped at
address A, the MCU's Bus maps three other *shadow* peripherals: 

| Name | Address | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| *Peripheral_XOR* | A+0x1000 | `REGISTER` = `REGISTER` ^ value (XORs the new value with the original register value) | 
| *Peripheral_SET* | A+0x2000 | `REGISTER` = `REGISTER` \| value (sets all the `1` bits of value in the original register) |
| *Peripheral_CLR* | A+0x3000 | `REGISTER` = `REGISTER` & !value (for every `1` bit in the value, clears the corresponding bit in the original register) |
:::

#### Configure the GPIO

To connect the *SIO* peripheral to the output pins, developers have to modify the `GPIOx_CTRL` register.

Each GPIO pin has its own control register, located at offset $40014000h + 4 + 8 * pin$.

<div align="center">
![MCU Pins](images/gpio_status_ctrl.png)
</div>

:::tip

For example, `GPIO25_CTRL`'s address is `0x40014000 + 4 + 8 * 25` = `0x400140CC`.
.

Pin 25 is connected to the onboard LED of the Raspberry Pi Pico.

:::

The following table shows the fields of the `GPIOx_CTRL` register. The fields that is of interest is `FUNCSEL`.
Depending on the value written there, the *IO Bank0* will select a function or another. For this example,
we have to write value `5`.

<div align="center">
![MCU Pins](images/gpio_ctrl_register.png)
</div>

```rust
const GPIOX_CTRL: u32 = 0x4001_4004;

// compute the address of the GPIOx_CTRL register
let gpio_ctrl = (GPIOX_CTRL + 8 * LED) as *mut u32;

// write the value 5 to the FUNCSEL field
// Note: This actually writes the value 5 in FUNCSEL
//       and 0s in all the other field. While this
//       is fine for this example, usually a
//       read, modify, write sequence should be used
unsafe { write_volatile(gpio_ctrl, 5); }
```

## Debouncing techniques for stable input reading.

Noise is produced whenever a pushbutton or other switch is moved. Because the switch contact is made of metal and has some elasticity, there is some noise (contact). The switch literally bounces a few times once it makes contact with a metal surface when it is shifted into a new position. This contact is known as bounce. 

<div align="center">
![Button Bounce](images/button-bounce.png)
</div>

The image above shows the signal produced by a button when pressed.

The most correct way to correct the bouncing problem is the hardware one, but there are also software methods to correct the problem. For more details and examples, consult the documentation from Embassy and the examples provided by them.
