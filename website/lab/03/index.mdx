## Timing

In embedded applications, keeping track of time is crucial. Even for the simple task of blinking a led at a certain time interval, we need a reference of time that is constant and precise. 

### Clocks

A clock is a piece of hardware that provides us with that reference. Its purpose is to oscillate at a fixed frequency and provide a signal that switches from high to low at a fixed interval.

![ClockSignal](images/clock_signal.png)

The most precise type of clock is the crystal oscillator (XOSC). The reason why it is so accurate is because it uses the crystal's natural vibration frequency to create the clock signal. This clock is usually external to the processor itself, but the processor also has an internal clock (ROSC) that is less accurate and that can be used in cases where small variations of clock pulses are negligible. When using the USB protocol, for instance, a more stable clock signal is required, therefore the XOSC is necessary. The crystal oscillator on the Raspberry Pi Pico board has a frequency of 12MHz.

This clock signal is just a reference, and most of the time we need to adjust it to our needs. This is done by either multiplying or dividing the clock, or in other words, elevating or lowering the frequency of the clock. For example, the RP2040 itself runs on a 133MHz clock, so the crystal oscillator frequency of 12MHz is multiplied (this is done using a method called Phase-Locked Loop). Similarly, the RP2350, the successor to the RP2040, also uses a PLL to adjust the 12MHz reference clock but supports a higher clock speed of 150MHz. This increased clock speed, along with more precise frequency control and improved power management, makes the RP2350 more versatile for both high-performance and energy-efficient applications.

### Counters

A counter in electronics is a tool that keeps track of numbers. It adds one to its total every time the clock ticks. When the counter reaches its highest possible number, it can't go any higher, so it resets back to zero and starts counting again. This reset is called an "overflow".

:::info
A regular counter on 8 bits would count up from 0 to 255, then loop back to 0 and continue counting. 
:::

In theory a counter is associated with 3 registers:

| Register | Description |
|-----------|----------|
| `value` | the current value of the counter |
| `direction` | whether the counter is counting UP or DOWN |
| `reset` | if the direction is UP, the value at which the counter resets to 0; if the direction is DOWN, the value at which the counter reset after reaching 0 |

![Counter](images/counter.svg)

The way the counter works here is that it increments/decrements every clock cycle and checks whether or not it has reached its reset value. If is has, then it resets to its initial value and starts all over again.


#### SysTick

The ARM Cortex-M for RP2040 and ARM Cortex-M33 for RP2350 use the SysTick time counter to keep track of time. This counter is decremented every microsecond, and when it reaches 0, it triggers an exception and then resets.

- `SYST_CVR` register - the value of the timer itself
- `SYST_RVR` register - the reset value
- `SYST_CSR_SET` register:
	- `ENABLE` field - enable/disable the counter
	- `TICKINT` field - enable/disable exception on reaching 0

### Timers

Until now, we have been able to blink a led at a certain time interval, by busy waiting a while between each led toggle. The technique we used so far was asking the processor to skip a clock cycle a number of times, or by calling the processor instruction `nop` (no operation) in a loop. 
:::info
This method is not ideal, since the `nop` instruction stalls the processor and wastes valuable time that could otherwise be used to do other things in the meantime. To optimize this, we can use *alarms*.
:::
An **alarm** is a counter that triggers an interrupt every time it reaches a certain value. This way, an alarm can be set to trigger after a specific interval of time, and while it's waiting, the main program can continue executing instructions, and so it is not blocked. When the alarm reaches the chosen value, it goes off and triggers an interrupt that can then be handled in its specific Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).

![Alarm](images/alarm.svg)

:::info
The **RP2350** timer, like the **RP2040's**, is fully monotonic, meaning it can never truly overflow. Its value is stored on 64 bits and increments every 1 microsecond, ensuring precise and consistent timekeeping. This means the last value it can increment to before overflowing is 2<sup>^64-1</sup>, which is equivalent to roughly 500,000 years. The RP2350 also supports 4 different alarms (TIMER_IRQ_0/1/2/3), which can be used independently, allowing for multiple timed events or tasks to be managed simultaneously.
:::

## Analog and Digital Signals

**Analog signals** are a representation of real-world data. They communicate information in a continuous function of time. They are smooth and time-varying waves, and contain an infinite number of values within the continuous range. An example of an analog signal would be sound, or the human voice.

![AnalogSignal](images/analog_signal.png)

**Digital signals** are a discrete representation of data. They are represented by a sequence of binary values, taken from a finite set of possible numbers. They are square and discrete waves. In most cases, they are represented by two values: 0 and 1 (or 0V and 5V). Digital representation of signals is usually used in hardware.

![DigitalSignal](images/digital_signal.png)

## Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)
Up to now, we learned to turn a led on and off, or in other words, set a led's intensity to 100% or 0%. What if we wanted to turn on the led only at 50% intensity? We only have a two-level digital value, 0 or 1, so technically a value of 0.5 is not possible. What we can do is simulate this analog signal, so that it *looks* like the led is at half intensity. 

**Pulse-Width Modulation** is a method of simulating an analog signal using a digital one, by varying the width of the generated square wave. 

![PWMExample](images/pulse-width-modulation-signal-diagrams-average.png)

:::note
We can think of the simulated analog signal being directly proportional to the change in digital signal pulse size. The larger the square wave at a given period T, the higher the average analog amplitude output for that period.
:::

The **duty cycle** of the signal is the percentage of time per period that the signal is high.

![DutyCycle](images/duty_cycle.png)

So if we wanted our led to be at 50% intensity, we would choose a duty cycle of 50%. By quickly switching between high and low, the led appears to the human eye as being at only 50% intensity, when in reality, it's only on at max intensity 50% of the time, and off the rest of the time.

![PWMLed](images/pwm_led.gif)

$$

duty\_cycle = \frac{time\_on}{period} \%

$$

For the RP2350 and RP2040, to generate this PWM signal, a *counter* is used. The PWM counter is controlled by these registers (`X` can be from 0-7, depending on the channel):

- `CHX_CTR` - the actual value of the counter
- `CHX_CC` - the value that the counter will compare to
- `CHX_TOP` - the value at which the counter will reset (or *wrap*)

When `CHX_CTR` is reset, the value of the output signal is 1. The counter counts up until it reaches `CHX_CC`, after which the value of the output signal becomes 0. The counter continues to count until it reaches `CHX_TOP`, and then the signal becomes 1 again. This way, by choosing the value of `CHX_CC`, we set the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

![PWMRP2040](images/pwm_rp2040_example.png)

On RP2350 and RP2040, all GPIO pins support PWM. Every two pins share a PWM slice, and each one of them is on a separate channel. 

![RP2040PWMPins](images/pwm_rp2040_pins.png)

:::info
This means that in order to use a pin as PWM, we need to know what channel it's on, and which output it uses (A or B).
:::

### Examples of hardware controlled through PWM

- leds
- motors
- buzzers
- RGB leds (what we will be using for this lab)

An **RGB** LED is a led that can emit any color, using a combination of red, green and blue light. On the inside, it's actually made up of 3 separate leds:
- *R* led - to control the intensity of the *red* light
- *G* led - to control the intensity of the *green* light
- *B* led - to control the intensity of the *blue* light

By using PWM on the R, G and B leds, we can control each of their intensity to represent any color.

:::info
For example, if we wanted to create the color purple, we would set the intensity of red and blue to 100%, and the intensity of green to 0%.
:::

There are two different types of RGB LEDs:

- common cathode: all LED cathodes are connected together. A LOW signal means off, and a HIGH signal means on at max intensity.
- common anode: all LED anodes are connected together. A LOW signal means on at max intensity, and a HIGH signal means off.

![CommonAnodeCommonCathode](images/common_anode_common_cathode.png)

:::warning
For this lab, we will be using **common anode** RGB LEDs, which means that the PWM signal should be *opposite*. 0 will be 100% intensity, and 1 will be 0% intensity.
:::

#### How to wire an RGB LED

The RGB led that the board provide is signaled with labels `RGB_B` (blue), `RGB_G` (green) and `RGB_R` (red) in the connectors section.

![RGBWiring](images/board_rgb.png)

#### How to wire a servo motor

A **servo motor** is a motor that can be controlled with PWM. It has a arm that can be rotated to a specific angle, depending on the PWM signal it receives.

A servo motor has three wires:
- **Power** - usually red, connected to a voltage source (5V)
- **Ground** - usually black, connected to the ground
- **Signal** - usually orange, connected to a PWM pin
![ServoMotorWiring](images/servo_wires.png)

The servo motor that the board provide is signaled with labels `GND`, `PWR` and `SIG` in the connectors section.

![ServoMotor](images/board_servo.png)

To wire the servo motor to the  Raspberry Pi Pico 2, jumper wire is needed to connect the `SERVOS` connector to PWM pins on the board.

### PWM in Embassy-rs

First, we need a reference to all peripherals, as usual. 

```rust
// Initialize peripherals
let peripherals = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());
```

In order to modify the PWM counter configurations, we need to create a `Config` for our PWM.

```rust
use embassy_rp::pwm::Config as ConfigPwm; // PWM config

// Create config for PWM slice
let mut config: ConfigPwm = Default::default();
// Set top value (value at which PWM counter will reset)
config.top = 0x8000; // in HEX, equals 32768 in decimal
// Set compare value (counter value at which the PWM signal will change from 1 to 0)
config.compare_a = config.top / 2;
```

In the example above:
    - `top` is the field from `Config` that will define the value at which the counter will reset back to 0
    - `compare_a` is the field from `Config` that will define the value at which the PWM signal will switch from 1 to 0
In this case, `config.compare_a` is half of `config.top`. This means that the duty cycle of the generated PWM signal will be 50%, or, in other words, that the PWM signal will switch from 1 to 0 halfway through each period.

To select the pin that we want to use for PWM, we need to create a new PWM driver that uses the correct channel and output for our pin.

```rust
// Create PWM driver for pin 0
let mut pwm = Pwm::new_output_a( // output A
    peripherals.PWM_CH0, // channel 0
    peripherals.PIN_0, // pin 0
    config.clone()
);
```

:::warning
1. The code above is an example for pin 0. You need to modify the channel, output and pin depending on the PWM pin you choose to use!
2. The value of `compare_a` or `compare_b` must be changed depending on the desired duty cycle!
:::

If we decide to modify the value of `compare_a` or `compare_b`, we have to update the configuration for the PWM.

```rust
config.compare_a += 100; // modified value of `compare_a`
pwm.set_config(&config); // set the new configuration for PWM
```

### Controlling a Servo Motor Using PWM

Just like controlling other hardware through PWM, we start by initializing the peripherals:

```rust
// Initialize peripherals
let peripherals = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());
```
Next, we configure the PWM

```rust
use embassy_rp::pwm::{Pwm, Config as PwmConfig};

// PWM configuration for the servo
let mut servo_config: PwmConfig = Default::default();
servo_config.top = 0x9999; // Set the PWM period to 0x9999 (in HEX) because the servo motor has a period of 20ms
servo_config.compare_a = 0x07AE; // Initial position of the servo motor
servo_config.divider = 64_i32.to_fixed(); // Set the frequency divider for PWM 
```

After setting up the PWM configuration, we want to create a control loop that can dynamically adjust the servo's position.

```rust
let mut servo = Pwm::new_output_a(peripherals.PWM_CH2, peripherals.PIN_X, servo_config);

let min_pulse = 0x07AE;  
let max_pulse = 0x0F5C;  

    loop {
        // Move the servo to the maximum position
        servo_config.compare_a = max_pulse;
        servo.set_config(&servo_config);
        Timer::after_millis(1000).await; // Wait for 1 second

        // Move the servo back to the minimum position
        servo_config.compare_a = min_pulse;
        servo.set_config(&servo_config);
        Timer::after_millis(1000).await; // Wait for 1 second
    }
```


## Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

Now we know how to represent an analog signal using digital signals. There are plenty of cases in which we need to know how to transform an analog signal into a digital one, for example a temperature reading, or the voice of a person. This means that we need to correctly represent a continuous wave of infinite values to a discrete wave of a finite set of values.
For this, we need to sample the analog signal periodically, in other words to measure the analog signal at a fixed interval of time. This is done by using an **Analog-to-Digital converter**.

The ADC has two important parameters that define the quality of the signal representation:

| Parameter | Description | Impact on quality |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sampling Rate | Frequency at which a new sample is read | The higher the sampling rate, the more samples we get, so the more accurate the representation of the signal |
| Resolution | Number of bits which we can use in order to store the value of the sample | The higher the resolution, the more values we can store, so the more accurate the representation |

:::info
For example, a resolution of 8 bits means that we can approximate the analog signal to a value from 0 to 255.
:::

### Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem

The [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem) serves as a bridge between continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. It establishes a link between the frequency range of a signal and the sample rate required to avoid a type of distortion called *aliasing*. Aliasing occurs when a signal is not sampled fast enough to construct an accurate waveform representation.

For an analog signal to be represented without loss of information, the conversion needs to satisfy the following formula:

$$
sampling_f >= 2 \times max_{f}
$$

The analog signal needs to be sampled at a frequency greater than twice the *maximum frequency* of the signal.
In other words, we must sample at least twice per cycle.

### Examples of analog sensors

- temperature sensor
- potentiometer
- photoresistor

A **photoresistor** (or photocell) is a sensor that measures the intensity of light around it. Its internal resistance varies depending on the light hitting its surface; therefore, the more light there is, the lower the resistance will be. 

![Photoresistor](images/photoresistor.png)

#### How to wire a photoresistor

The photoresistor that the board provide is signaled with label `PHOTORESISTOR` in the connectors section.

![PhotoresistorWiring](images/board_photoresistor.png)

:::info
To wire a photoresistor on your board at home, you need to connect one leg to *GND* and the other leg to a voltage divider. Take a look at the [Electronics](/tutorial/electronics/index.md#voltage-divider) tutorial:
$$
V_{out} = V_{in} * \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}};
$$

In our case:
- $ V_{out} $ will be the voltage at the ADC pin on the MCU
- $ V_{in} $ will be the voltage at the from the GPIO pin the photoresistor is tied to
- $ R_{1} $ is the variable resistance of the photoresistor
- $ R_{2} $ is a resistance compatible with our photoresistor (in our case, 10k $\Omega$)

This way, the ADC pin measures the photoresistor's resistance, without the risk of a short-circuit.
:::


### ADC in Embassy-rs

On the RP2040, ADC uses an interrupt called `ADC_IRQ_FIFO` to signal whenever a new sample has been added to the ADCs' FIFO. This new sample will be stored inside a FIFO. In the Embassy library, this interrupt is already implemented, so all we need to do is bind it and use it in our ADC variable.

```rust
// Bind the `ADC_IRQ_FIFO` interrupt to the Embassy's ADC handler
bind_interrupts!(struct Irqs {
    ADC_IRQ_FIFO => InterruptHandler;
});

// ---- fn main() ----

// Initialize peripherals
let peripherals = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());

// Create ADC driver
let mut adc = Adc::new(peripherals.ADC, Irqs, Config::default());
```

:::warning
If we are using PWM and ADC in the same code, we will have two different `Config` imports with the same name. In order to avoid compilation errors, we need to separate the PWM config import from the ADC one. To do this, we can import the two `Config`s with different names.

```rust
use embassy_rp::adc::Config as ConfigAdc; // ADC config

// ---- fn main() ----
let mut adc = Adc::new(peripherals.ADC, Irqs, ConfigAdc::default());
```
:::

Now, we need to initialize the ADC pin we will be using. The Raspberry Pi Pico has 3 pins that support ADC: `ADC0`, `ADC1`, and `ADC2`.

```rust
// Initialize ADC pin
let mut adc_pin = Channel::new_pin(peripherals.PIN_X, Pull::None); // where X should be replaced with a pin number
```

Once we have the ADC and pin set up, we can start reading values from the pin. 

```rust
let level = adc.read(&mut adc_pin).await.unwrap(); // read a value from the pin
info!("Light sensor reading: {}", level); // print the value over serial
Timer::after_secs(1).await; // wait a bit before reading and printing another value
```

## Exercises

:::info
For this lab, you will need to use the Embassy library. If you haven't already set it up, check the [Getting Started](../../tutorial/embassy/index.md) tutorial.
:::

:::info
If you need to remember the layout of the board, check the [Lab Board](./02#the-lab-board) section from the previous lab.
:::

:::danger 
Please make sure the lab professor verifies your circuit before it is powered up.
:::

1. Write a program using Embassy that adjusts the brightness of an LED connected to GPIO pin by changing the PWM duty cycle. 
    - Light up the LED at 25% intensity. (**1p**)
    - Make the LED change intensity from 0% to 100% in 10% increments every 1 second. (**1p**)
:::info
To remeber how to set up Embassy, check [Exercise 1](./02#exercises) from last week's lab.
:::

2. Write a program using Embassy to control the led intensity using a potentiometer. The potentiometer is connected to an ADC-capable GPIO pin. The LED should change intensity based on the potentiometer's position. (**2p**) 

:::warning 
Unlike the photoresistor, which requires an external resistor to form a voltage divider, a potentiometer already has an internal voltage divider. You only need to connect its three pins:
    - One leg to VCC.
    - The middle pin to an ADC-capable GPIO pin.
    - One leg to GND.
    
    (The potentiometer that the board provide is signaled with label `POTENTIOMETER` in the connectors section.)
:::

3. Make the RGB LED switch from red -> yellow -> blue every time the button `SW4` is pressed. (**2p**)
:::note
The reason why we **can't** use `GP2`, `GP3` and `GP4` for the RGB LED, for example, is because `GP2` and `GP3` are both on PWM channel 1, therefore we can't independently control them with PWM.
:::
![Colors](images/colors.png)

4. Write a program using Embassy that measures light intensity using a photoresistor connected to ADC.
    - Use `defmt` to display the measured light intensity. (**1p**)
    - Make the RGB LED change color based on the light intensity. Red for low intensity, green for medium intensity, and blue for high intensity. (**1p**)

5. Write a program using Embassy that moves a servo motor smoothly between 0° and 180°, then back to 0°, in a continuous loop. (**2p**)
