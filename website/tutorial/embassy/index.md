# Embassy-rs Setup

Here, we will cover the steps needed in order to be able to compile and flash Rust applications for **RP2040**, the MCU (Microcontroller Unit) found in our **Raspberry Pi Pico W**s.

## Prerequisites

### Rust Toolchain

In order to install the tools needed to compile Rust code, follow the next steps, depending on your operating system.

#### Linux

Run the this command in terminal:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This downloads and runs `rustup-init.sh`, which in turn downloads and runs the correct version of the `rustup-init` executable for your platform.


#### Windows

Download the respective executable:

* [RUSTUP-INIT.exe - 64bit](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe)
* [RUSTUP-INIT.exe - 32bit](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe)

:::note
You may be prompted to install [Visual Studio C++ Build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). If so, follow the instructions from the previous link.
:::

The last step is to run `rustup --version` in terminal. If everything went well, you should see an output similar to this:

```shell
rustup 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)
info: This is the version for the rustup toolchain manager, not the rustc compiler.
info: The currently active `rustc` version is `rustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)`
```

### `elf2uf2-rs`

This is one of the tools we will need in order to program the board over USB. In order to install it, run the following in your terminal:

```shell
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
```

Then, run `elf2uf2-rs --help`. If it was correctly installed, you should see something similar to this in your terminal:

```shell
Usage: elf2uf2-rs [OPTIONS] <INPUT> [OUTPUT]

Arguments:
  <INPUT>   Input file
  [OUTPUT]  Output file

Options:
  -v, --verbose  Verbose
  -d, --deploy   Deploy to any connected pico
  -s, --serial   Connect to serial after deploy
  -h, --help     Print help
```

### `probe-rs`

This tool is an embedded debugging and target interaction toolkit. It enables its user to program and debug microcontrollers via a debug probe.

#### Linux

:::info 

Before installing probe-rs, you need to install  `pkg-config`, `libudev`, `cmake` and `git`. You can get them by running the following in your terminal. If any of these programs are already installed on your machine, you can omit them from the command.
```shell
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libudev-dev cmake git
```

:::

```shell
cargo install probe-rs-tools --locked
```

You will also need to add this [`udev`](https://probe.rs/files/69-probe-rs.rules) file in `/etc/udev/rules.d`. Then, run:

```shell
udevadm control --reload # to ensure the new rules are used.

udevadm trigger # to ensure the new rules are applied to already added devices.
```

#### Windows

:::info
You will have to make sure that [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/download/) is installed and that it is added to your `$PATH`.
:::

Once `cmake` is set up, you can run
```shell
cargo install probe-rs-tools --locked
```
and no further configuration is required.

### VSCode Extension

For a better experience, go ahead and install the **Debugger for probe-rs** extension in the Microsoft Extension Marketplace. This will allow us to build and upload a program to the RP2040 directly from VSCode and it will make debugging the program while running on the MCU as easy as debugging a Rust program running on your host machine.

## Flashing over USB

This section demonstrates some of the various ways you can build your code and flash it to the board. If you wish to try them out and see how they work, you should first head over to the [Building your first Embassy-rs project](#building-your-first-embassy-rs-project) section, follow the instructions and then come back. You will also find an [example](#mainrs) of code that you can use as your `main.rs` file.

### Configuring Cargo

You will notice that some of the options will suggest creating and modifying a `config.toml` file. It is not strictly necessary for flashing, but it is highly recommended, especially since you will need it for debugging anyway.

In order to add the configuration file, you will first have to create a `.cargo/` directory in your project's root folder. Inside it, create the `config.toml` file. You cand find a complete configuration example [here](#configtoml). For more information on this type of file, follow the official [Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html).

### Compiling

You will need to compile your executable specifically for the RP2040 chip. This chip is based on the **ARM Cortex M0+** architecture, so we will need to specify our target when compiling. We can do that in multiple ways, but first we will need to install the Rust ARMv6-M target (thumbv6m-none-eabi):

```shell
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

Now you can build by:

#### 1. Passing the target as a parameter to Cargo:

```shell
cargo build --release --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

:::info

You can also use `build` without the `--release` option. This way, the rust compiler will not apply any optimisations to your code and a `debug` build will be generated. 

:::

#### 2. Using a `.cargo/config.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"
```

This allows us to simply run

```shell
cargo build
```

without having to specify the target every time. 

### Flashing

To flash a program to the Raspberry Pi Pico via USB, it needs to be in *USB mass storage device mode*. To put it in this mode, you need to **hold the `BOOTSEL` button down**  while connecting it to your PC. Connecting and disconnecting the USB can lead to the port getting damaged, so we conveniently attached a reset button on the breadboard included on the **Pico Explorer Base**. Now, to make it reflashable again, just press the two buttons simultaneously.

After connecting the board to your PC and compiling the program, locate the binary in the `target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/` (or `target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/` if you didn't use the `--release` option) folder. There are a few ways to flash the binary to the board:

#### 1. Using `elf2uf2-rs`:

Run this command:

```shell
elf2uf2-rs -d -s /path/to/your/binary
```

* `-d` to automatically deploy to a mounted pico
* `-s` to open the pico as a serial device after deploy and print serial output
  
:::note
On `Windows`, you may need to run this command in a terminal that has **Admin Privileges**.
:::

#### 2. Using `probe-rs`:

You can run

```shell
probe-rs run --chip RP2040 --protocol swd --speed 16000 /path/to/your/binary
```

This will flash the board without starting `probe-rs`' debugging functionality.

#### 3. Configuring Cargo to do it

If you've already created a `.cargo/config.toml` with a build target, you can add these lines to the file:

```toml
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-rs run --chip RP2040 --protocol swd --speed 16000"
```

Now, 

```shell
cargo run 
```

will automatically call the command from option 2, without having to specify the path to the binary.

:::tip
As it will be required later in the tutorial, you should also add

```toml
[env]
DEFMT_LOG = "debug"
```

which tells cargo that your program will use **deferred formatting** to more efficiently send logs to the host machine via a serial interface. You can learn more about `defmt` [here](https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/). At this point, your configuration file should look like this:
##### config.toml
```toml
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-rs run --chip RP2040 --protocol swd --speed 16000"

[build]
target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"

[env]
DEFMT_LOG = "debug"
```
:::

#### 4. Using the **Debugger for probe-rs** extension

This method can be used from VSCode's **Run and Debug** view. The binary will be flashed to the board by `probe-rs` and the debugging mode will be running by default. However, this option requires further configuration of the project which will be detailed in the next section of this tutorial. 

## Debugging
### With the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe

In order to be able to debug the program running on the board, we will need to connect the **Raspberry Pi Debug Probe** to our **Raspberry Pi Pico W**. Below, you have a picture of the debug kit provided:

![Raspberry Pi Debug probe](assets/the-probe.png)

To connect them, we will use the **3-pin debug to 0.1-inch header (female)** cable. First, carefully insert the **3-pin debug** head in the **right side** connector (marked D). Then you will also need to connect it to the Raspberry Pi Pico W. You will find attached the pinout, take a closer look at the bottom of the image:

![Raspberry Pi Pico W pinout](assets/picow-pinout.svg)

The connections must be:

| Wire | Raspberry Pi Pico W |
|-|-|
|TX (Orange)|SWCLK|
|GND (Black)|GND|
|RX (Yellow)|SWDIO|

:::warning
Do not forget to connect both the Debug Probe and Pico to your PC.
:::

The simplest way to start debugging is to use the **Run and Debug** view in Visual Studio Code. If you already have a `.cargo/config.toml` file, make sure the following lines are included. If this file doesn't exist yet, create it and add these lines: 

```toml
[env]
DEFMT_LOG = "debug"
```

Then, you will need to create `.vscode/launch.json`. VSCode should give you this option when entering the **Run and Debug** menu:

![Run and Debug menu](assets/run_and_debug.png)

Here is an example of such a file:

##### launch.json

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "preLaunchTask": "rust: cargo build",
            "type": "probe-rs-debug",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "launch request",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "chip": "RP2040",
            // RP2040 doesn't support connectUnderReset
            "connectUnderReset": false,
            "speed": 4000,
            "runtimeExecutable": "probe-rs",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "dap-server"
            ],
            "flashingConfig": {
                "flashingEnabled": true,
                "haltAfterReset": false,
            },
            "coreConfigs": [
                {
                    "coreIndex": 0,
                    // Modify this path to match your project's name
                    "programBinary": "target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/project_name",
                    // Comment this line if the svd file is not present
                    "svdFile": "./.vscode/rp2040.svd",
                    "rttEnabled": true,
                    "options": {
                        "env": {
                            "DEFMT_LOG": "debug"
                        }
                    },
                }
            ],
            "consoleLogLevel": "Info", //Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace
            "wireProtocol": "Swd"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::warning
Remember to modify the path provided to the `"programBinary"` attribute so that it matches with the one you want to debug. It will most likely have a different name and it might also be located in `release/` instead of `debug/` depending on your build options.  
:::

You can find out more about this configuration file and available options, as well as the debugging process itself from the official [probe-rs documentation](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/debugger/).

A recommended step is to download the [`rp2040.svd`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/1.3.1/src/rp2040/hardware_regs/rp2040.svd) file and place it in the `.vscode/` directory, as it gives `probe-rs` and VSCode additional information on the registers and memory regions used by the MCU. If you aren't using this file, the `"svdFile"` attribute should be commented out or removed from `launch.json`.

### With another Raspberry Pi Pico

Another interesting way to debug programs running on the board is to use a second Raspberry Pi Pico. In fact, the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe itself is based on the same RP2040 MCU, running custom firmware. The custom boards in the labs also use a Pi Pico as a debugger and you can, as well, since the firmware is freely available.

The first step is to connect the two boards together. We will use a normal Pico (without wifi) as a debugger for this tutorial, but its pinout is almost identical to the Pico W.

![Raspberry Pi Pico pinout](assets/pico-pinout.svg)

We will refer to our Pico's as Pico A (the debugger) and Pico B (the one running our program). These are the connections you need to make:

| Pico A | Pico B |
|-|-|
| GND | GND |
| GP2 (Pin 4) | SWCLK |
| GP3 (Pin 5) | SWDIO |
| GP4/UART1 TX (Pin 6) | GP1/UART0 RX (Pin 2) |
| GP5/UART1 RX (Pin 7) | GP0/UART0 TX (Pin 1) |
| VSYS (Pin 39) | VSYS (Pin 39) |

You can also try to follow the following wiring diagram if you're using a breadboard. Pico A is on the left (and connected to a host machine via USB) and Pico B is on the right.

![Pico to Pico wiring](assets/pico_wiring.png)

:::note
You will be using the Pico W as the second board, unlike the one depicted here.
:::

The next step is flashing the firmware to the debugging board. Download the [`debugprobe_on_pico2.uf2`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe/releases/tag/debugprobe-v2.2.1) file. Hold the `BOOTSEL` button down while connecting the board to your PC. It should show up as a USB drive named `RPI-RP2`. Next, simply copy the `.uf2.` file to the board to flash it. You should now be able to use the Pico you just flashed as a debugger for the Pico W. 

:::info
Only the board you are using as a debugger should be plugged into the USB port on your machine, since the other one is powered through the `VSYS` pin.
:::

## Building your first Embassy-rs project

In this section, we will briefly go over the steps you need to take in order to get your first project using **Rust** and **Embassy-rs** going.

### Creating your crate

The first step is to create your cargo package by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
cargo new --vcs none embassy
```

* `--vcs none` because at the moment we do not want to use any code versioning (they are useful, but this is not the purpose of this tutorial)

### Crate settings

Because we are running in an embedded environment, our code needs to be *"tailored"* specifically for the microcontroller we intend to use. In our case, it is the **RP2040**, but these general steps apply for any chip, produced by any manufacturer.

#### No standard library

Due to the size constraints imposed on us (in our case, `2MB` of flash memory), the standard library has to go. We specify that by adding the `#![no_std]` attribute to the beginning of our `src/mains.rs` file.

#### No `main` function

Because we are using the **Embassy-rs** framework, we want to let it take care of the entry point of our program (because it has to do some complex operations, like allocating the `task-arena` and `executor` structures). For the moment, all we will need to do is add the `#![no_main]` attribute to `src/main.rs`.

#### Toolchain setting

Our chip is a **Cortex-M0+** that uses the **ThumbV6-M** architecture so we will need to specify the target triple we are compiling for. We will do that using a `rust-toolchain.toml` file, as it allows us to also set the **toolchain release channel** we will use, and the components we require.

An example of such file is this:

##### rust-toolchain.toml

```Toml
# This file is used to specify the version of the Rust toolchain that 
# should be used for your project.

[toolchain]
# The release to be used.
channel = "1.83"
# The targets for compilation that need to be added. This is used for 
# cross-compilation, as the executables we are producing need to be
# run on our boards.
targets = ["thumbv6m-none-eabi"]
# The additional componets to be installed along the Rust toolchain
components = ["rust-src", "rustfmt", "llvm-tools", "clippy"]
```

:::tip

Please make sure that you install the Rust ARMv6-M target (thumbv6m-none-eabi).

```bash
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

:::

#### Memory layout

We also need to take care of the memory layout of our program when writing code for a microcontroller. These can be found in the datasheet of all the microcontrollers. Bellow, you can find the memory layout for the **RP2040**:

##### `memory.x`

```linker-script
/* Memory regions for the linker script */
/* Address map provided by datasheet: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf */
MEMORY {
    /* Define the memory region for the second stage bootloader */
    BOOT2 : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 0x100

    /* Define the memory region for the application to be loaded next */
    FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x10000100, LENGTH = 2048K - 0x100

    /* Define the memory region for SRAM */
    RAM   : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 264K
}
```

To use the `memory.x` layout file, we will also need to use a build script. Rust facilitates that through the `build.rs` file. Bellow you will find an explained build script you can use.

##### `build.rs`

```rust
//! This build script copies the `memory.x` file from the crate root into
//! a directory where the linker can always find it at build time.
//! For many projects this is optional, as the linker always searches the
//! project root directory -- wherever `Cargo.toml` is. However, if you
//! are using a workspace or have a more complicated build setup, this
//! build script becomes required. Additionally, by requesting that
//! Cargo re-run the build script whenever `memory.x` is changed,
//! updating `memory.x` ensures a rebuild of the application with the
//! new memory settings.

use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    // Put `memory.x` in our output directory and ensure it's
    // on the linker search path.
    let out = &PathBuf::from(env::var_os("OUT_DIR").unwrap());
    File::create(out.join("memory.x"))
        .unwrap()
        .write_all(include_bytes!("./memory.x"))
        .unwrap();
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-search={}", out.display());
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={{layout}}");

    // `--nmagic` is required if memory section addresses are not aligned to 0x10000,
    // for example the FLASH and RAM sections in your `memory.x`.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=--nmagic");

    // The `link.x` linker script provided by `cortex_m_rt` (minimal runtime for
    // Cortex-M microcontrollers used by embassy) will include our `memory.x` memory layout.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=-Tlink.x");

    // The `link-rp.x` linker script provided by `embassy_rp` that defines the
    // BOOT2 section.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins=-Tlink-rp.x");

    // The `defmt.x` linker script provided by `defmt`.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins=-Tdefmt.x");
}
```

:::info
These three files should be found in the root folder of your project (same directory as `Cargo.toml`).
:::

#### Adding the Dependencies

At this step, we must add the dependencies we will use for our project. Bellow you will find the basics you will need for a minimal application, including an `usb_logger` to *"enable"* debugging over serial.

##### `embassy-executor`

This is an `async/await` executor designed for embedded. To add it as a dependency to your project, run:

```shell
cargo add embassy-executor --features arch-cortex-m,executor-thread,executor-interrupt,task-arena-size-32768,defmt
```

* `arch-cortex-m` - feature to specify we are running on the cortex M architecture
* `executor-thread` - enable the thread-mode executor (using WFE/SEV in Cortex-M, WFI in other embedded archs)
* `executor-interrupt` - enable the interrupt-mode executor (available in Cortex-M only)
* `task-arena-size-X` - sets the task arena size
* `defmt` - use deferred formatting for logs

We will also need to add the `cortex-m` and `cortex-m-rt` crates as dependencies, as the `#[executor::main]` attribute depends on the minimal startup code for the Cortex M microcontrollers found in this crates. To do that, run:

```shell
cargo add cortex-m
cargo add cortex-m-rt
```

##### `embassy-time`

This crate enables timekeeping, timeouts and delays. Add it by running:

```shell
cargo add embassy-time
```

#### `embassy-rp`

This crate is a **Hardware Abstraction Layer** for the **RP2040**. You can add it to your project like so:

```shell
cargo add embassy-rp --features time-driver,critical-section-impl,rp2040,defmt
```

* `time-driver` - enable the timer for use with `embassy-time` with a `1MHz` tick rate.
* `critical-section-impl` - configure the critical section crate to use an implementation that is safe for multicore use on RP2040
* `rp2040` - this crate also works for other Raspberry MCU's,
so we need to specify the one we are using

#### `embassy-usb-logger`

USB implementation of the `log` crate. It allows the usage of `info!` macro and some more. To add it, run the following command:

```shell
cargo add log
cargo add embassy-usb-logger
```

#### `probe-panic`

This crate adds a panic handler for the microchip that prints panic messages over **JTAG**, and in order to add it, run:

```shell
cargo add panic-probe
```

#### `rp-pac`

This crate is a dependency for `embassy-rp`, but we need to explicitly add it to our project to avoid linker errors, as this crate also works for the RP2350 MCU.

```shell
cargo add rp-pac --features cortex-m-rt,defmt,rp2040,rt
```

Finally, we should add the `defmt` and `defmt-rtt` crates, as we will be using some of the macros defined by the former to send logs back to our host. The latter crate transmits the log messages over the RTT (Real-Time Transfer) protocol.

```shell
cargo add defmt
cargo add defmt-rtt
```

### The code

Here you can find a minimally explained code that prints `"Hello World!"` over the serial interface and demonstrates how two different tasks can be run concurrently. 

#### `main.rs`

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use defmt::*;
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_rp::gpio::{self};
use embassy_time::{Duration, Timer};
use {defmt_rtt as _, panic_probe as _};

// Async task to send a log message
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn print_task() {
    loop {
        info!("Print task");
        Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    }
}

#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    // Initialize peripherals
    let p = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());

    Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    info!("Hello world!");

    // Spawn the print task
    Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(1)).await; 
    spawner.spawn(print_task()).unwrap();

    loop {
        // Print a message from the main task as well
        info!("Main task");
        Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(3)).await;
    }
}
```

You can run this by using

```shell
cargo run
```

or by starting the `launch request` task at the top of the **Run and Debug** menu.
